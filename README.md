## Advices

This module is intended for use with [TWBase Theme](https://github.com/drupix/twbase).

The additional features provided by this module are:

* a `prose` (`tw-prose`) wrapper class is added to the editor `body` that allows tailwindcss-typography to works correctly while editing a node in the admin section
* **extra styles** are added to a better match with tailwindcss-typography like `p.lead` and `code` and custom colors (`text-primary`, `text-secondary`, `text-success`, `text-danger`, `text-warning`, `text-info`) and `dropcap` for a Dropcap (big letter at the beginning of a sentence/word) have been also added
* an admin interface is provided to edit the showcase content
* and last but not least: it allows you to define showcase options per content type ü•≥

**To have extra styles working you must add the "Styles" button to your CKEditor configuration at `/admin/config/content/formats/manage/full_html`**
